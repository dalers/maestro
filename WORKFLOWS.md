These are sample SCC (Swift Construction Workflows), based on the Aircraft Wireless product.

The SCC buys assembled electronics circuit boards (Part Number 20000003) in lots of 10 from Trilogy-Net.  The circuit boards are used to manufacture Aircraft Wireless units (PN 10000003). When circuit boards from Trilogy-Net arrive at the SCC, they are inspected and, if acceptable, identified with a serial number and stored on a shelf. One of the SCCâ€™s customers is B&E Submarines, who some time ago purchased an Aircraft Wireless system from the SCC to evaluate.

The products (part numbers), customer (B&E) and supplier (Trilogy-Net) have been created. Two BoMs have been created, one for the finished Aircraft Wireless product (PN 10000003) and one for a spare parts kit (PN 60000001), which includes the electronics circuit board (PN 20000003).

did not create custom stages for "Sales Department" as shown in book, however...

    why isn't Jacab Wood shown as Team Members?!?
    could add manually but did not (unsure if need to and also implications of doing so)
    profile for Jacab shows Default Sales Team = Sales Department - perhaps only when documents "pushed" from user?

## Reporting
### Serialized Stock Purchased by a Customer

This workflow explores serialized stock in the context of a customer purchase. B&E Submarines desires to purchase a spare parts kit for the Aircraft Wireless unit they previously purchased. A serialized circuit board is used in the assembly of the spare parts kit (preferably a phantom-type BoM to make the parts in it visible), which is then sold and delivered to B&E.

Sometime later, Ed Bentley calls from B&E. He says he found a circuit board, but he doesn't know if it is the circuit board from the spares kit. Ed is not sure, but he thinks the original board might have failed and he swapped it with the one from the spare parts kit. Ed wants to know if the serial number on the board is the same as the board shipped in the spare parts kit he bought.

### Serialized Stock Consumed by a Project

Explore serial numbers in the context of a project. B&E Submarines plans to upgrade 5 of their submarines with Aircraft Wireless systems. A contract is negotiated between the SCC and B&E, and the SCC initiates a Project to capture all related activity (of which the physical receiver units are only one portion). Complete radio receivers PN 10000003 are manufactured, each with its own serial number, traceable to the serialized electronics circuit board within. The completed radio receivers are sold and delivered to B&E as part of the overall project.

Sometime later, Ed Bentley calls from B&E. He has a circuit board in his hand again, and wants to know where the serial number came from. Ed asks if the circuit board was from one of the 5 receivers delivered as part of the upgrade project.
