Maestro
=======
***Maestro***<sup>*TM*</sup> is ***The ERP for Engineers***<sup><em>TM</em></sup>, an open-source web-based ERP system that provides ***Transparency with Trust***<sup><em>TM</em></sup> to design, manufacturing and support teams.

*Maesto is in active development and is likely not suitable for use in production.*

Maestro manages information related to projects, parts, stock, issues and people. Drawing inspiration from  [*Parts&Vendors*<sup>*TM*</sup>](http://www.trilogydesign.com/), Maestro includes enterprise features, single-entry accounting, and true multi-user operation.

Maestro includes a complete data set for the fictional ***Swift Construction Company*** (the *SCC*), including projects, parts, stock (unserialized, serialized and lot controlled), issues and users. A demo is available for evaluation at  [swiftconstructioncompany.net](http://www.swiftconstructioncompany.net). 

Maestro is developed as an open source project and uses the permissive business-friendly [BSD 2-Clause License](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause) for maximum flexibility of use to the Maestro community. The goal of the Maestro project is to provide a superior integrated business management solution to small-to-medium enterprises (SME) for managing parts, projects, material, issues and people.
