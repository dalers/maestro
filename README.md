maestro
=======

***Maestro***(TM) is a cohesive enterprise model to explore, evaluate and demonstrate business workflows with ERP and ERP-like systems, with an emphasis on processes related to parts, projects, material, issues and people. Maestro is based on a well-defined fictional going concern - the Swift Construction Company (the *SCC*).

The purpose of the Maestro project is to create, as a community, a shared knowledge base of operational practices based on a common data set, based on a philosophy of *Transparency with Trust*

Maestro has been used with a number of applications, including:
* [Tryton](http://www.tryton.org)
* [OpenERP](http://www.openerp.com)
* [Parts&Vendors(TM)](http://www.triogydesign.com)
* [Maestro-Yii](http://www.github.com/dalers/maestro-yii)
* [WebERP](http://www.weberp.org)
