**Maestro**<sup>*TM*</sup> is a cohesive business model for exploring, evaluating and demonstrating workflows using ERP-like software, with an emphasis on parts, projects, material, issues and people. Maestro includes data and scripted procedures for working with specific ERP software (currently concentrating on [ERPNext](https://www.erpnext.com), a relatively new free and open source web-based ERP application). 

Maestro is based on a well-defined going concern - the fictional Swift Construction Compan (SCC). The SCC provides the context for exploring design, manufacturing and sales processes, and for demonstrating to others the benefits of shared immediate access to critical information, including parts, projects, material (including serialized and lot identified and controlled), issues and people.
