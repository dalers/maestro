**Maestro**<sup>*TM*</sup> is a cohesive enterprise model for exploring, evaluating and demonstrating business workflows using ERP and ERP-like systems, with an emphasis on processes related to parts, projects, material, issues and people. Maestro is based on a well-defined fictional going concern - the Swift Construction Company.

The Swift Construction Company (SCC) provides the context for exploring design, manufacturing and sales processes, and to demonstrate the benefit to workers and teams of having shared immediate access to critical information, including parts, projects, material (serialized or otherwise controlled), issues and people.
