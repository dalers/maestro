ToDoList was used initially to create issues for Maestro, although Issues
have most recently been updated using Mantis itself, and todolist.tdl updated
after the fact.

* Create issues in ToDoList
* Export from ToDoList to CSV
    * import to .../maestro/scc/tdl/todolist-scc.edited.ods
    * edit "created by" to meet issue story in wiki
    * add uid lookup for "created by" (created-uid column)
    * add uid lookup for "assigned to" (assigned-uid column)
    * export as todolist-scc-edited.csv
