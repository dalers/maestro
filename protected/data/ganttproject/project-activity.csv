Correct mechanical dimensions of the PCB, create Master Drawing for the PCB, create assembly drawing and work instruction for circuit board assembly. Update work instruction for custom inductor PN 20000001 for clarity (primarily formatting changes,  the rev level was not changed as no changes affected the part itself - fit, form or function).",,240.0

Location of holes in the enclosure base and lid were adjusted for the new circuit board orientation, and enclosure artwork modified accordingly. To document the changes, the PCA assembly diagram and work instruction were updated for the tuning capacitor being mounted on the opposite side of the PCB, and the enclosure-level assembly diagram and work instruction were updated for PCA mounting change (orientation and new shorter standoffs).",Miquel DeLazes,700.0

The lifting gas is party hydrogen and generated on board. Forward power was generated by a 20-cylinder air-cooled engine (invented by Barton Swift), driving two 8-foot diameter airscrews in a push-pull configuration. Crusing speed is 30 mph with top speed of 80mph (in a moderate wind). Amenities included an observation car with pilot gear, floor-mounted windows and easy chairs, slept 5, and had an electric stove and furnace in the galley.",,0

The hull is triple layered, with a secret inner material for added strength, can remain submerged for 30 days and has a cruising speed of 14mph. Propulsion comes from a gasolene engine driving motor dynamos which then power a new electrical hydrodynamic drive. Two electric cannons firing 25 pound solid shots are provided for repelling sea monsters. The submarine carries all-metal diving suits of a type which require no air hoses or safety lines, using automatic air tanks instead.",,0

The range of the discharge as well as its force can be adjusted, and the charge can travel through walls without loss of energy. The Electric Rifle resembles an over-sized heavy-game firearm, although weighing significantly less and having various dials, levers, gears and wheels on the shoulder stock. Power is provided by a charge storage cylinder in the butt-stock, charged by a small hand-operated dynamo.",,0
11,photo-telephone,1/1/15,1/1/15,1,0,,,7,0,,,The Photo Telephone was based on a standard telephone but using a three-wire interface instead of the typical two (the third carrying the picture data). A pair of charged selenium plates connected to an audio amplifier are used in both the transmit and receive path. The picture is fixed by a kilo-volt charge and then plate developed using a wet continuous chemical process (similar to that used for standard photographic plates and film). A permanent recording of both picture and voice can be made at the receiving station.,,0
