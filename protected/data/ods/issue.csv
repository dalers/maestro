30,Customers asking for field spares kit.,Connectivity of PCB-type inductor in layout is incorrect.,,1,1,2,,6,2014-09-17,11,2014-09-17,
29,Difficult assembly procedure,Difficult to assemble and test PCA due to copper-side-up orientation. Orienting PCA component-side up allows for full access to components for debugging after assembly.,,1,1,2,,3,2014-09-17,22,2014-09-17,
28,Incorrect PCB layout,,,1,1,1,,3,2014-09-17,22,2014-09-17,
17,Iteration 1 - Release prototype PCA,"Release PN 20000004 Rev 00 with child parts and sub-assemblies for building a small number of prototype units. Assembly to include functional PCA, earphone, wire for stubby antenna and preliminary user manual (NO enclosure). Manufacturing process documentation to include product part breakdown structure diagram, work instruction for packing beta test units and a work instruction for fabricating PN 20000001 (custom inductor).",,1,1,1,,3,2012-12-31,6,2014-09-17,
18,Iteration 2 - Make PCB corrections,Revise schematic to correct connectivity of PCB-type inductor; revise PCB design to correct the inductor layout and mechanical dimensions (and generate new CAM files). Create PCB master drawing. Create PCA assembly drawing and work instruction. Update work instruction for custom inductor PN 20000001 to meet revised format requirements (rev level will not change as fit/form/function remains the same).,,1,1,2,,3,2013-01-01,6,2014-09-17,
19,Iteration 3 - Release marketing assembly,"Re-structure product to meet product release requirements, including creation of new top-level marketing assembly part number. Product to include enclosure with hardware, user manual and earphone to be moved to marketing assembly, stubby antenna removed, user manual to be updated.",,1,1,2,,,2013-01-02,6,2014-09-17,
20,Iteration 4 - Reduce cost and improve quality,"Invert PCB in enclosure to aid assembly and test (requiring modifications to enclosure base and lid, including artwork). Update PCA assembly diagram and work instruction, update enclosure-level assembly diagram and work instruction.",,1,1,2,,,2013-01-03,6,2014-09-17,
21,Iteration 5 - Release field service kit,Create kit of parts found typically useful for field service.,,1,1,2,,6,2013-01-04,6,2014-09-17,
