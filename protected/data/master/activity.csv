1,prototype 1,2015-01-01,2015-01-28,20,100,1.1,280,,"Release of PN 20000004 Rev 00 Parts List with child parts and assemblies for building a small number of prototype units. Assembly includes an earphone, wire for a stubby antenna and preliminary user manual, but no enclosure. Manufacturing process documentation includes a product part breakdown structure diagram, a work instruction for packing beta test units and a work instruction for fabricating PN 20000001 (custom inductor).",6,1,2015-01-01,6,2015-01-01,6

Correct mechanical dimensions of the PCB, create Master Drawing for the PCB, create assembly drawing and work instruction for circuit board assembly. Update work instruction for custom inductor PN 20000001 for clarity (primarily formatting changes,  the rev level was not changed as no changes affected the part itself - fit, form or function).",6,1,2015-01-01,6,2015-01-01,6

Location of holes in the enclosure base and lid were adjusted for the new circuit board orientation, and enclosure artwork modified accordingly. To document the changes, the PCA assembly diagram and work instruction were updated for the tuning capacitor being mounted on the opposite side of the PCB, and the enclosure-level assembly diagram and work instruction were updated for PCA mounting change (orientation and new shorter standoffs).",18,1,2015-01-01,6,2015-01-01,6
