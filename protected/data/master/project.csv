1,Overhead,OVRHD,Work not within the scope of an existing project.,,,,,,,,,
2,Aircraft Wireless,P2015-001,"2-seat racing monoplanes are a popular new sport, and the wireless set allows air crews to receive messages from their ground crew while in-flight. The wireless will be smaller and weigh significantly less than comparable sets. The project is sponsored by the Universal Flying Machine Company.",3,6,6,1,1,2015-01-01,6,2015-01-01,6
3,Target Finder,P2015-002,"The Target Finder will provide the means for accurately placing fire extinguisher bombs launched from Lucifer - the aerial fire-fighting platform designed by Tom Swift. Factors the Target Finder will take into account include the speed and altitude of Lucifer, the wind velocity and the weight of the fire-fighting grenades.",,22,1,0,1,2015-01-01,6,2015-01-01,6
4,Aero-Dirigable,P2015-003,"The Aero-Dirigible will combine conventional biplane wings and twin control rudders, with a rigid, multi-cell aluminum ""gas bag"" for vertical takeoff and landing. The lifting gas will be party hydrogen, and generated on board. Forward power will be generated by a 20-cylinder air-cooled engine invented by Barton Swift, driving two 8-foot diameter airscrews in a push-pull configuration. The crusing speed of the Aero-Dirigible will be 30 mph, with a top speed of 80 mph (in a moderate wind). Amenities will include an observation car with pilot gear, floor-mounted windows and easy chairs, sleeping for 5, and an electric stove and furnace in the galley.",,22,1,0,1,2015-01-01,6,2015-01-01,6
5,Submarine,P2015-004,"The Submarine will be designed by Barton Swift, and will be 100 ft long with a 20 ft beam. The hull will be triple layered, and include a secret inner material for added strength. The Submarine will be able to remain submerged for 30 days, and will have a cruising speed of 14mph. Propulsion will come from a gasolene engine driving motor dynamos, which then power a new electrical hydrodynamic drive. Two electric cannons firing 25 pound solid shots will be provided for repelling sea monsters. The Submarine will carry all-metal diving suits of a type requiring no air hoses or safety lines, and will use new automatic air tank technology instead.",,22,1,0,1,2015-01-01,6,2015-01-01,6
6,Rechargeable Battery,P2015-005,"The Rechargeable Batter will be based on a new technology using nickle oxide, ferric oxide and steel tubes, and use a lithium hydrate (wet) electrolyte. It is expected that cells will recharge in half the time compared as traditional wet cells, and with a quantum increase in energy density. The Rechargeable Battery is required for a new 4-seat electric runabout being considered, where the batteries will be charged from a charging station, or by connection to a trolley line or street lamp.",,22,1,0,1,2015-01-01,6,2015-01-01,6
7,Electric Rifle,P2015-006,"The Electric Rifle will be a personal protection device based on throwing electric charge. The range as well as the force of the discharge will be adjustable, and the charge will to travel through walls without loss of energy. The Electric Rifle is expected to resemble a convention heavy-game rifle, but weigh significantly less. Operating controls (various dials, levers, gears and wheels) will be provided on the shoulder stock. Power will be provided by a charge storage cylinder in the butt-stock, charged by a small hand-operated dynamo.",,22,1,0,1,2015-01-01,6,2015-01-01,6
8,Photo-Telephone,P2015-007,"The Photo-Telephone will be based on a standard telephone, but will use a three-wire interface instead of the typical two, with the third wire carrying picture data. A pair of charged selenium plates connected to an audio amplifier will be used in both the transmit and receive path. The picture will be fixed by a kilo-volt charge, and the plate developed using a continuous wet chemical process. It will be possible to make a permanent recording of both picture and voice at the receiving station.",,22,1,0,1,2015-01-01,6,2015-01-01,6
9,Hercules 0001,P2015-008,"Hercules 0001 will be a 285-ton electric-drive locomotive in a 4-12-4 configuration. The 12 main driving wheels will be 70 inches in diameter, and will be powered by six dual-motor DC motors providing 4400 total horsepower. Power will be provided from a twin overhead pantograph, connecting to 3000 volt DC distribution line. The Hercules will be 90 ft overall, 10 ft wide, and 14 ft tall, and have a top speed of 120 mph on level track.",,22,1,0,1,2015-01-01,6,2015-01-01,6
