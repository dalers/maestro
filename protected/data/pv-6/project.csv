1,aircraft wireless,P2015-001,A wireless set to receive messages from the ground crew in the new and popular 2-seat racing monoplanes. The new wireless will be smaller and weigh significantly less than comparable sets. This project is sponsored by the Universal Flying Machine Company.,3,6,3,2,1,2015-01-01,6,2015-01-01,6
2,target finder,P2015-002,"The analog TargetFinder was designed for Lucifer, an aerial fire-fighting platform designed by Tom Swift, and provided a method for accurately placing fire extinguisher bombs. Factors taken into account by the targetfinder include the speed of the airship, the airship altitude, the wind velocity, and the weight of the fire-fighting grenades.",,22,1,2,1,2015-01-01,6,2015-01-01,6
3,aeroplane-dirigable,P2015-003,"A combination aeroplane-dirigible with conventional biplane wings and twin control rudders, and a rigid, multi-cell aluminum ""gas bag"" providing for vertical takeoff and landing. The lifting gas is party hydrogen and generated on board. Forward power was generated by a 20-cylinder air-cooled engine (invented by Barton Swift), driving two 8-foot diameter airscrews in a push-pull configuration. Crusing speed is 30 mph with top speed of 80mph (in a moderate wind). Amenities included an observation car with pilot gear, floor-mounted windows and easy chairs, slept 5, and had an electric stove and furnace in the galley.",,22,1,2,1,2015-01-01,6,2015-01-01,6
4,submarine,P2015-004,"Designed by Barton Swift, the submarine is 100 ft long with a 20 ft beam. The hull is triple layered, with a secret inner material for added strength, can remain submerged for 30 days and has a cruising speed of 14mph. Propulsion comes from a gasolene engine driving motor dynamos which then power a new electrical hydrodynamic drive. Two electric cannons firing 25 pound solid shots are provided for repelling sea monsters. The submarine carries all-metal diving suits of a type which require no air hoses or safety lines, using automatic air tanks instead.",,22,1,2,1,2015-01-01,6,2015-01-01,6
5,rechargeable wet battery,P2015-005,"The battery is based on a new technology using nickle oxide, ferric oxide and steel tubes with a lithium hydrate electrolyte. Cells can be recharged in half the time as with a comparable wet cell design with a quantum increase in energy density. The battery was designed to power a 4-seat electric runabout, charging the batteries from a charging station or by connection to a trolley line or street lamp.",,22,1,2,1,2015-01-01,6,2015-01-01,6
6,electric rifle,P2015-006,"The electric rifle is a personal protection device based on throwing electric charge. The range of the discharge as well as its force can be adjusted, and the charge can travel through walls without loss of energy. The Electric Rifle resembles an over-sized heavy-game firearm, although weighing significantly less and having various dials, levers, gears and wheels on the shoulder stock. Power is provided by a charge storage cylinder in the butt-stock, charged by a small hand-operated dynamo.",,22,1,2,1,2015-01-01,6,2015-01-01,6
7,photo-telephone,P2015-007,The Photo Telephone was based on a standard telephone but using a three-wire interface instead of the typical two (the third carrying the picture data). A pair of charged selenium plates connected to an audio amplifier are used in both the transmit and receive path. The picture is fixed by a kilo-volt charge and then plate developed using a wet continuous chemical process (similar to that used for standard photographic plates and film). A permanent recording of both picture and voice can be made at the receiving station.,,22,1,2,1,2015-01-01,6,2015-01-01,6
8,electric drive locomotive,P2015-008,"The Hercules 0001 is a 285 ton electric drive locomotive in 4-12-4 configuration. The 12 main driving wheels are 70 inches in diameter and powered by six dual-motor DC motors providing 4400 horsepower in total. Power is supplied through a twin pantograph overhead pickup from a 3000 volt DC line. The locomotive is 90 ft overall, 10 ft wide, and 14 ft tall, with a top speed of 120 mph on level track.",,22,1,2,1,2015-01-01,6,2015-01-01,6
