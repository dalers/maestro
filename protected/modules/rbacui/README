rbacUI 1.0.5
============

rbacUI is an extension to the Yii Framework (http://www.yiiframework.com/license/) 
in the form of a module. rbacUI adds and integrates an UI for maintaining rbac 
to an existing Yii application.


##Requirements

Yii 1.1 and above.
Javascript enabled webbrowser.

##Usage

* Extract the zip file to the application's protected/modules directory
* Edit your configuration to register the module (the default option values may 
  need to be adjusted):
~~~
[php]
'modules'=>array(
	'rbac'=>array(
		'class'=>'application.modules.rbacui.RbacuiModule',
		'userClass' => 'User',
		'userIdColumn' => 'id',
		'userNameColumn' => 'username',
		'rbacUiAdmin' => true,
		'rbacUiAssign' => true,
	),
),
~~~

* rbacUI requires a user database table to be present that at least contains an 
  integer User ID field and a varchar User name field. rbacUI also expects 
  Yii::app()->user->id to return the User ID, not the User name. The model for 
  the user table and the column names for the User ID column and the User name 
  column are part of the module options. Also rbacUI expects the component for
  the AuthManager to be defined for the application.
* Log in to your application.
* Navigate to http://<your base url>/rbac.
* Create a role for the rbacUI administrator and a role for the rbacUI operator. 
  Assign the administrator role to yourself.
* Change the module parameter settings for 'rbacUiAdmin' and 'rbacUiAssign'
  to the names of the roles you just created.

##Options

The following configuration options can be used:
userClass:      	The model name of the database table that contains the user 
					authentication information for User ID and User name 
					(default value: 'User').
userIdColumn:   	The column name of the User class field that contains the 
					User ID (default value: 'id').
userNameColumn: 	The column name of the User class field that contains the 
					User name (default value: 'user').
userActiveScope: 	The scope that is used for selecting active users (default 
					value: false).
					The default value false means that no scope is used for 
					selecting users to be displayed.
rbacUiAdmin:		The role name for the rbacUI administrator (default value: 
					false).
					The rbacUI administrator can create/update/delete 
					authorization items and assign/revoke authorization items 
					to/from users.
					The default value false means that no one has access to 
					this functionality.
rbacUiAssign:		The role name for the rbacUI operator (default value: false).
					The rbacUI operator can only assign/revoke authorization 
					items to/from users.
					The default value false means that no one has access to 
					this functionality.
rbacUiAssignRole:	The role name for the rbacUI role operator (default value: 
					false).
					The rbacUI operator can only assign/revoke roles to/from 
					users.
