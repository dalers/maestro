<p>Maestro is <b><em>The ERP for Engineers</em></b><sup><em>TM</em></sup>, an open-source web-based ERP system providing <b><em>Transparency with Trust</em></b><sup><em>TM</em></sup> to design, manufacturing and support teams.</p>

<p>Maestro manages information relating to projects, parts, stock, issues and people. Taking inspiration from <a href="http://www.trilogydesign.com/"><em>Parts&Vendors</em></a><sup><em>TM</em></sup>, Maestro adds enterprise features, single-entry accounting, and true multi-user operation. Maestro also works cooperatively with <a href="http://www.ganttproject.biz/"><em>GanttProject</em></a> to provide a Gantt-style native client for project management.</p>

<p>Maestro includes a complete data set for the (fictional) <b><em>Swift Construction Company</em></b> (the <em>SCC</em>), including projects, parts, stock (unserialized, serialized and lot controlled), issues and people. This Maestro system has been loaded with SCC data, and is the demo site for the <a href="http://www.github.com/dalers/maestro/">Maestro development project</a>.</p>
