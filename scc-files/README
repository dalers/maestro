Maestro SCC Demo/Test Data

The documented product is the SCC Aircraft Wireless. Current information 
at each iteration in its product lifecycle has been captured, including 
related documents. This allows the iterations to be "played back" as they
occured sequentially in time. 

Iterations:

  1  Printed Circuit Assembly    2013-01-01
  2  Revised PCB                 2013-01-02
  3  Product Release             2013-01-03
  4  Manufacturing Improvements  2013-01-04
  5  Field Spares Kit            2013-01-05

Directory and file timestamps conform to iterations dates. Dates within 
files (e.g. the date in a drawing title block) conform to iteration 
dates as much as is possible. Refer to the Maestro project wiki for more 
information on the changes in each iteration. 

Iterations in Parts&Vendors data versus vault documents
-------------------------------------------------------
Parts&Vendors iteration databases contain "current" data as of that 
iteration (e.g. pv-1.mdb, pv-2.mdb...). Vault directories are
likewise named by iteration (e.g. vault-1, vault-2...).

Files in vault directories vault-1/, vault-2/... have the file version
included in the filename (e.g. vault-1/parts/10000001_PBS-00.pdf).

Files in vault directories vault-1-norev/, vault-2-norev/... do not have 
the file version included in the filename. Different iterations may 
include files that are different but have the same filename (e.g. 
vault-1-norev/parts/10000001_PBS.pdf, vault-3-norev/parts/10000001_PBS.pdf).

Only files added or modified by an iteration are included in the 
respective vault. This is done to more easily manage file and directory 
dates by iteration. To reconstruct the complete "current" file system 
for a particular iteration, copy vault iterations in order "on top of"
a generic "vault" directory; start with the initial iteration and continue
up to and including the desired iteration (preserve file timestamps).
