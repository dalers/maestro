Assembly to include functional PCA, earphone, wire for stubby antenna and preliminary user manual (NO enclosure). Manufacturing process documentation to include product part breakdown structure diagram, work instruction for packing beta test units and a work instruction for fabricating PN 20000001 (custom inductor)."
2,Make PCB corrections,2,,5,0,0,2013-01-01,Frank Mason,fmason,2014-09-06,2013-01-01,2013-01-02,Barcoe Jenks,bjenks,Open,Wireless,0,Revise schematic to correct connectivity of PCB-type inductor; revise PCB design to correct the inductor layout and mechanical dimensions (and generate new CAM files). Create PCB master drawing. Create PCA assembly drawing and work instruction. Update work instruction for custom inductor PN 20000001 to meet revised format requirements (rev level will not change as fit/form/function remains the same).
