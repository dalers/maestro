## Using Launchpad ##

- [Sign up on Launchpad](https://login.launchpad.net/+new_account)
- add OpenSSH key (required to store/commit code) (the ONLY method that worked for me using Windows/PuTTY was to copy the key exactly as provided in the Puttygen "Key / Public Key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file" windows - open your private key file first with Puttygen if necessary)
- add OpenPGP key (required to at least sign Ubuntu code of conduct, but appears also required for authentication within groups of all other than submitting code, and to gain karma points). It appears possible to use "gpg" included with GitExtensions/git (but not from within BHI firewall)

- [Join OpenERP Community Team](https://launchpad.net/~openerp-community/+join)
 - [List of sub-teams](https://launchpad.net/~openerp-community-reviewer/+participation)

 - Must be approved by a team to be a committer, who can review other patches, commit patches in the community repository and write news on the "Planet OpenERP RSS".
